/**
 * Functions
 *      set of code to perform a specifc task
 * 
 * Before we create a function:
 * 1. what is the purpose of the function?
 *      this helps in function name
 * 2. Do I need any input from user?
 *      If yes,
 *          a) how manay inputs we need from user?
 * 
 * 3. Should the function return any value back to user?
 *      If yes,
 *          make sure to write return statement as the last line in the function
 *      otherwise
 *          NO return statement in the function
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Syntax to create a function:
 * 
 * #1:
 * function funcName(<inputParameters>) {
 *      code inside
 *      the function
 *      return statement    --> ONLY IF we are planning that function should return a vaule back to user (Q3); LAST LINE of the function.
 * }
 * 
 * funcName -> function-name (it should relate to the purpose of the function)
 * 
 * inputParameters -> Q2
 *      if we need input from user
 *          we need to create variable in the parenthesis
 *      else
 *          parenthesis will be empty
 *
